        <h1>Introduction to Linux OS</h1>
        <h2 class="title">What is an Operating System?</h2>
        <p class="answer"> An Operating System (OS) is special software that controls everything in your computer. It helps manage both the hardware (like the CPU, memory, and storage) and the software (like applications). The OS provides a user interface to help you do things like run apps, manage files, and handle input/output tasks. Examples of operating systems are Windows, macOS, and Linux. It ensures that all parts of your computer work together smoothly and that different users and programs can share resources efficiently.</p>

        <h2 class="title">What is Linux?</h2>
        <p class="answer">Linux is an open-source, Unix-based operating system created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It's used everywhere, from smartphones and servers to supercomputers and embedded systems. Since it's open-source, anyone can view, modify, and share its code, creating a community of collaborators and innovators.</p>
